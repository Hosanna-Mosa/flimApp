## 🧪 Testing the Backend

### **1. Start the Server**
Your server is already running on `http://localhost:8000`

### **2. Test with Thunder Client / Postman**

**Create a Community:**
```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/communities
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Bollywood Filmmakers",
  "description": "For Bollywood professionals",
  "type": "industry",
  "industry": "bollywood",
  "privacy": "public",
  "tags": ["filmmaking", "bollywood"]
}
```

**Join a Community:**
```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/join
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Create a Poll:**
```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/posts
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "groupId": "GROUP_ID",
  "type": "poll",
  "content": "Best Bollywood movie of 2024?",
  "poll": {
    "question": "Best Bollywood movie of 2024?",
    "options": [
      {"text": "Movie A"},
      {"text": "Movie B"},
      {"text": "Movie C"}
    ]
  }
}
```
